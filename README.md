## CEDAR -Canonn Elite Dangerous Automated Relay

The **Canonn Elite Dangerous Automated Relay** is a system for willing Commanders to share dynamic data about the science of Elite: Dangerous with others.  
By pooling data in a common format, tools and analyses can be produced that add an even greater depth and vibrancy to the in-game universe.

CEDAR is not run by or affiliated with [Frontier Developments](http://www.frontier.co.uk/).
